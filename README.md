# Hello, this is Daniel!

I'm now working full-time at IBM, and studying Supply Chain Management (part-time) at the National University of Singapore.

To offer more value to both my current and future employers, I am actively teaching myself programming and data anlytics.

As such, I am focused on creating Python-related projects to bring value to different aspects of the supply chain, such as optimization, analytics, forecasting, etc.
